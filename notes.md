# Intro to Ruby

## What is Ruby

- programming language
- backend program
- easy to read
- object-oriented programming

- classes vs instances

classes - blueprint for what each object is going to look like/behavior

## Methods

- behaviors 

- puts vs return vs print

- puts = print something out for our user to see / returns nil /
- print = provides output / return nil / 

- return - stores data to memory for possible later usage

to test out code => ruby hello.rb, make sure invoke the method

arguments/parameters 
    - wrapped in paranthesis
    - variables as placeholders
    - wrong number of arguments (given 0, expected 1)

    - optional arguments give you the ability to define a method to either accept and argument or omit an argument 

## Variables

- what are variables? something that you give a value to, value placeholders, identifiers

- a label on a box that stores some data

name = "aysan"

uninitialized constant Aysan

## Data Types

- strings = wrapped around with quotes "aysan"
- integers = numbers 1 2 3 
- arrays = [1, 2, 3, "Loren", true, :key] a collection of data
- boolean = true or false values 
- hashes = key/value pair :name => "Momo"/ name: "Momo"
- symbols = :symbol

## Conditionals

conditional statements: if/else statements 
gives code logic
control flow
- execute logic based on a condition met

what do conditions return? boolean values: true or false

## Blocks => times block, loops while & until

- benefit? extra code, repetetive code
- times block allows execution of code a certain amount of times
- repeat a behavior UNTIL a condition is met

+= => logical operator

what it does: adds/increments by the number, then sets value of variable to new value
